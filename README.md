lifestreams.data_server
=======================

This is a simple Tomcat server that serves processed data generated by [Lifestreams](https://github.com/ohmage/lifestreams) and implements the access control based on the [ohmage](https://github.com/ohmage/server) server. 

To login, a user has to provide his/her ohmage credentials; the web server will use the credentials to sign in ohmage and obtain:
* First, a list of participants whose data is accessible by this user.
* Second, an access token of this user.
 
Both these information will be returned to the user. In the subsequent request, the user can use the token to query the Lofestreams data of which his/her has access to.
